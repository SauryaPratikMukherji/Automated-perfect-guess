# Automated-perfect-guess
Perfect guess game automated
Hello everyone I am Saurya. I am in the first year of btech.
In this project, what I did is not difficult but I got the idea myself. What I did is at first I gave two options to the user that whether he wants the play the game himself or he wants a bot to play for him. If he chooses a computer will itself play for him but if he chooses b then the player has to play by himself just like the normal perfect guess
The automated part of the game is nothing difficult it's just that I used random method for both user and omputer if the player chooses a bot to play for him. 
THANK YOU!
